Project 1: Basic Business or Personal Website
Name: Christopher Onelli

The website that will be created will be for a small pizza business looking to detail their mission statement and history of the store, showcase the menu, and receive feedback or inquiries through a contact section. 

Within this website you will able obtain information on the landing page, switch tabs to look at the menu, as well as switch tabs once again to submit any feedback you may have. 

This project utilized html and css as well as utilizing bootstrap properties. 

Ideas for future improvement:
1. I liked the design of having most things centered, however, this has resulted in me having some problems adjusting things that arent centered. In the future I'd like to add a bit more variety to the web pages. 

2. I would also like to have stuck to my wireframe design on the menu page, I thought that was designed pretty well, however, it was a bit difficult to perfectly imitate. In the future I'd like to work on getting as close to that design as possible. 

3. At the start of the project I was committing multiple things at once which may be difficult for someone else to read. I feel I got a bit better towards the end of only committing a single thing, but this is something to be better at in the future.
